	One Idea which is not accurate since there are methods missing for the gravitational and computational requirements further to the ups.
	As the exponential force increases in all directions both in the subatomic and exponential growth, the energy required to contain the force must be equal to that consumed and yielded. In addition, provide enough energy to contain both opposing forces and suitable to yield the required energy resources to be put forward as a use case in renewable energy source provision.
	Or it is a representation of a transceiver at lower application in 3d space.
	
	Side thought after reading up a little on Lorentz, Green and Feld-Tai Reciprocity, the calculus above may yield some interesting results if exponents to the RTL with Lorentz, Feld-Tai or Green reciprocity in mind.
